## Shibiko AI ComfyUI Tools

### What is this?
This is a collection of tools that I use to make my life easier when developing ComfyUI applications. It is a collection of tools that I have created to help me with my development process. I have decided to share these tools with the community in the hopes that they will be useful to others as well. I use this tools to further develop features for https://shibiko.ai

### Notes
I put in credits for the original creators of the underlining tools that I use to create nodes. So links in each section are for each creator, repo, and patreon if they have one.

### Waifu2x
This tool is a simple wrapper around the waifu2x command line tool. It allows you to upscale images and remove noise using the waifu2x ai model. It produces high quality upscaled images that are suitable for use in ComfyUI applications.
